 <br> <b> Codsoft Internship Projects </b>
<br>Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Codsoft Internship! This repository showcases five tasks I completed as part of my internship, each designed to demonstrate skills in problem-solving, UI development, and project functionality.

<br><b>Project Overview</b>
<br>During the internship, I worked on various projects to build, improve, and demonstrate my skills in programming and software development. Here are the five tasks I completed:

<br><b>1. Number Guessing Game üé≤</b>
<br>A simple console-based game where users have to guess a randomly generated number. Includes features like a hint system, score tracking, and adjustable difficulty levels.

<br><b>2. Calculator üßÆ</b>

<br><b>3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game ‚úñÔ∏è‚≠ï</b>
<br>A fun, interactive game of Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. This application includes a simple user interface and checks for win, lose, and draw conditions.
