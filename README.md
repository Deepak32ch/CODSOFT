 <br> <b> Codsoft Internship Projects <b>
</b>Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Codsoft Internship! This repository showcases five tasks I completed as part of my internship, each designed to demonstrate skills in problem-solving, UI development, and project functionality.

</b><b>Project Overview<b>
</b>During the internship, I worked on various projects to build, improve, and demonstrate my skills in programming and software development. Here are the five tasks I completed:

</b><b>1. Number Guessing Game üé≤<b>
</b>A simple console-based game where users have to guess a randomly generated number. Includes features like a hint system, score tracking, and adjustable difficulty levels.

</b><b>2. Calculator üßÆ<b>
