 <br> <b> Codsoft Internship Projects <b>
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Codsoft Internship! This repository showcases five tasks I completed as part of my internship, each designed to demonstrate skills in problem-solving, UI development, and project functionality.

<b>Project Overview<b>
During the internship, I worked on various projects to build, improve, and demonstrate my skills in programming and software development. Here are the five tasks I completed:

<b>1. Number Guessing Game üé≤<b>
A simple console-based game where users have to guess a randomly generated number. Includes features like a hint system, score tracking, and adjustable difficulty levels.

<b>2. Calculator üßÆ<b>
A fully functional calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and may include advanced functions, depending on implementation.

<b>3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game ‚úñÔ∏è‚≠ï<b>
A fun, interactive game of Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. This application includes a simple user interface and checks for win, lose, and draw conditions.

<b>4. To-Do List üìù<b>
An organized to-do list manager that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This task focuses on data handling, UI simplicity, and usability.

Navigate to each project folder for specific instructions on how to run the program.

<b>Technologies Used<b>
Programming Language: c++
Libraries/Tools: vs code
